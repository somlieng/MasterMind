Master Mind game that uses animals instead of colors

This project was to build the game mastermind. My technique was to make the 
first 6 guesses be all of the same animal for the number of positions that
the player chose. This, in the end, provided me with all the animals that 
are going to be in the sequence. Then, I generated permutations of those
animals until it reached an answer, there are only 24 permutations possible.
